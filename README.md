# auto_Hyper-V_disable
if you try to execute Bluestack at docker installed environment, "How to disable Hyper-V on Windows for BlueStacks 4" problem may occurs.
This bat file will automatically disable Hyper-V and allow using Bluestack.
But if you want to use docker, you must set some settings again.(i'm looking forward to make it with bat file.)

## how to use
1. clone or download
2. execute disable_hyper-v.bat
3. Windows restarts automatically
4. run bluestack :)
